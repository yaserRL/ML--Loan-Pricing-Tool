Loan Pricing Tool

Overview

This Loan Pricing Tool provides a comprehensive framework for pricing loans and managing associated risks. The tool incorporates key risk components, cost structures, and profitability metrics to compute a fair interest rate for loans, ensuring banks adequately compensate for risks and achieve desired returns.

I worked on this project during my PhD in collaboration with a financial company, combining academic insights with industry practices to address real-world challenges in loan pricing and risk management.

This tool is designed for use in banking environments, especially for managing mortgage loans, bullet loans, and floating-rate loans, and supports risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) computations.

Key Features

Loan Pricing Framework:
Computes loan prices based on expected present value of future cash flows.
Handles various loan types:
Bullet loans (no amortization during the term),
Fixed-rate loans,
Floating-rate loans (LIBOR-based rates).


Risk Management:
Expected Loss (EL):
Accounts for default risks using a transition matrix for rating migrations and default probabilities.
Unexpected Loss (UL):
Calculates additional margins to meet regulatory capital requirements (e.g., Basel).
Recovery Rates:
Derives collateral value using Loss Given Default (LGD).
Prepayment Options
Models early redemption rates (ERR) for estimating prepayment impacts.
Supports future integration of stochastic interest rate models for prepayment valuation.
Profitability Metrics
Incorporates all cost components into pricing:
Hedging costs,
Expected and unexpected losses,
Funding costs,
Operating costs.
Computes RAROC to evaluate return on equity capital for individual loans.


Innovations

Combines credit risk modeling with loan pricing for better risk management.
Provides risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) as a key metric.
Facilitates future development with planned features like:
Stochastic models for interest rate forecasting,
Improved funding cost estimations based on dynamic yield curves.


Incorporate advanced stochastic interest rate models for prepayment valuations.
Develop dynamic funding cost estimations.
Extend risk modeling to integrate non-homogeneity adjustments for multi-period estimations.


How to Use:

Provide input parameters:
Loan details (type, maturity, interest rate, etc.),
Risk parameters (transition matrix, LGD, ERR, etc.).
Run the pricing tool to calculate:
Fair loan price,
Expected and unexpected losses,
RAROC and interest rate margins.
Analyze results to guide loan pricing strategies and portfolio risk management.
